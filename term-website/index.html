			<h2>The Mountain Spoke History</h2>
			<p>Our roots began back in 1972 at our original location, right here in Bozeman, Montana.  Founder John Doe and his family opened and operated the business with a passion and enthusiasm for all things bikes.  Due to their commitment to quality bicycles and trusted service and repairs, they made a name for themselves in the local community.  After being open for 10 years, they opened their 2nd and 3rd locations and never looked back.</p>
			<p>Starting in 1988, the Mountain Spoke teamed up with local cycling clubs to produce the first annual "Cycle the Continental Divide", the biggest annual cycling event in the state of Monatana.  Thousands of cyclists gather in the city of Billings to attend the exciting event. With participation numbers increasing each year, the event has become known nationwide.  This year, we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the event and anticitpate record-breaking attendance! Find more information on the event and how to register on the "Events" page.</p>
